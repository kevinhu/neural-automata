# neural-automata

Neural cellular automata implemented in PyTorch, based on https://distill.pub/2020/growing-ca/ (GitHub: https://github.com/google-research/self-organising-systems).

## Additions

The original article showed that automata could be trained using recurrent neural networks to accomplish the following:

1. Reach a target state after a certain number of iterations
2. Maintain such a target state
3. Regenerate from alterations to the target state

This repository modifies the training environment to show some new properties.

## Coupling of seed states to targets

## Control of growth stages

## Alternative objectives
